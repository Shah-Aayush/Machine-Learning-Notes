# Convolutional Neural Network

- What will be covered in this section : 
	- What are convolutional neural networks?
	- Step 1 : Convolutional Operation
	- Step 1(b) : ReLU Layer (Rectified Linear Unit)
		> Linearity is not good, we wan't non linearity in our model
	- Step 2 : Pooling
		- max,sum and min pooling
	- Step 3 : Flattening
	- Step 4 : Full Connection
	- Summary
	- Softmax & Cross-Entropy
